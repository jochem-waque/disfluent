# Fluent Commands

A fluent, Zod-like API for discord.js commands.

## Usage

After installing `disfluent` and adding `import d from "disfluent"` to a file,
defining a command can be as simple as:

```ts
d.slashCommand("ping", "Respond with pong").handler(async (interaction) => {
  await interaction.reply("Pong!")
})
```

More likely than not though, you'll want to add subcommands, options, choices
and autocomplete, which are all supported, of course:

```ts
d.slashCommand("examples", "Example commands")
  .integrationTypes(ApplicationIntegrationType.UserInstall)
  .subcommands({
    text: d
      .subcommand("Subcommand example")
      .options({
        body: d.option("Body text").string().required().maxLength(500),
        channel: d
          .option("Category channel")
          .channel()
          .required()
          .channelTypes(ChannelType.GuildCategory),
        choose: d
          .option("Option with choice")
          .integer()
          .choices({ first: 1, second: 2, third: 3 }),
        auto: d
          .option("Autocompleted number")
          .number()
          .autocomplete((value) => ({
            up: Math.ceil(parseFloat(value)),
            down: Math.ceil(parseFloat(value)),
          })),
      })
      .handler(async (interaction, { body, channel, choose, auto }) => {
        await interaction.reply(JSON.stringify({ body, channel, choose, auto }))
      }),
  })
```

In the second example, the type of the deconstructed parameter is inferred as:

```ts
{
  body: string
  channel: CategoryChannel
  choose?: 1 | 2 | 3
  auto?: number
}
```

## Why?

Because Discord.js's command builders just aren't good enough. Defining your
commands in one place and repeating all of the option names and types in another
is prone to errors and completely unnecessary. I already solved this problem
over a year ago. Now, I've solved it again, but more terse and elegant.
